# cobaltexample

This is an example app that shows how to use the [cobalt](https://github.com/ardanlabs/cobalt) framework to create a classic web application.

Templates are stored in the `templates/` folder and are accessed from within handlers with `ctx.ServeHTML`.

Template execution is configured in the `app` function of `main.go`.

A running demo of this app is at https://cobaltexample.herokuapp.com/
